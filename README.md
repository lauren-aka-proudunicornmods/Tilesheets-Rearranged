# Tilesheets-Rearranged Readme

## Installation

Drag `[CP] ProudUnicorns tiles` into your mods folder.

The mod will automatically determine which recolours you have (if any) and apply those tilesheets.

## What it does

This mod takes the two Vanilla tilesheets and from them loads four new tilesheets that can be used in any custom map.

- Spring_outdoorstilesheet
- Spring_outdoorstilesheet2
