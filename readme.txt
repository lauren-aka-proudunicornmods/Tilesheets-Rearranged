Please don't change the config!
It is just there to disable some tilesheets that don't exist yet, so when I add them I don't need to write any more json.

2. Installation

Drag [CP] ProudUnicorns tiles into your mods folder

3. Note

This mod takes some tilesheets from my slimehutch mods. If you want to use both, you will need to update slimehutch!
